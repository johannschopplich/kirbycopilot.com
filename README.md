# Kirby Copilot

Kirby Copilot is a plugin for [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com) that integrates AI capabilities directly into the Kirby Panel, allowing you to generate content directly from the Panel.

## Features

To streamline content creation for you or your clients and editors, Kirby Copilot offers:

- **AI-powered content generation**: Use OpenAI GPT models or Mistral's AI models to generate content.
- **Blocks support**: Generate content for blocks fields.
- **Customizable prompts**: Tailor AI responses with user-defined prompts.
- **Context-aware responses**: Include context from other fields with placeholders in user prompts to improve content relevance.
- **Playground**: Try out the plugin's features with an interactive live demo.

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment, [OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) such as GPT-4 and [Mistral models](https://mistral.ai/product/) are supported. We will add support for other AI providers if there is enough demand.

## Playground

Experience Kirby Copilot firsthand in the [interactive playground](https://kirbycopilot.com/playground).

To play with the plugin section, please enter your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) in the playground settings field. If you don't have an API key yet, you can register for the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com). The key is required to make client-side requests to the OpenAI API. For production use of the plugin, you will have to store the API key in Kirby's global configuration.

The key will be saved to the **session storage** of your browser. It will not be stored server-side or in any other way.
