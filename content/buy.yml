      content: The license allows you to use the plugin on as many sites as you want, as long as you are the owner of all the sites.
    - label: What do I get with my purchase?
      content: After your purchase, you will receive an email with a download link to a ZIP file containing the plugin. To install the plugin into your Kirby project, follow the instructions in the [documentation](/docs/getting-started/installation). We are currently working on Composer support.
    - label: Do I need an OpenAI API key?
      content: If you want to use GPT models then yes, you need a key for the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com) allowing Kirby Copilot request text completions from it. If you want to use Mistral models instead, you will need an API key for [Mistral](https://mistral.ai).

    - label: What does “Unlimited minor & patch updates” include?
      content: We add new features and improvements to Kirby Copilot as we get ideas and feedback. You will receive these updates for the major version you have purchased.
