## Panel File as Context Source

On a Kirby file page, you can set Kirby Copilot to pre-select the **current file as context** for the user prompt. This is useful if you want to generate text for a specific file, such as an image or PDF, that has already been uploaded to the Panel.

Consider the following scenario: Your client is concerned about accessibility and wants to use alt text for all the images on their website. It would be too cumbersome to manually select each image as the context for the prompt. Instead, you can set the `files` option to `auto` and let the plugin automatically read the uploaded file:

:prose-video{src="/vid/kirby-copilot-generate-image-alt.mp4" poster="/vid/kirby-copilot-generate-image-alt-poster.jpg" width="960" height="540"}

The following example shows how to use the current file of a Kirby file model as context for the user prompt:

```yaml
sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      alt:
        label: Alternative Text
        type: text

  copilot:
    type: copilot
    # Write the generated text to the `alt` field
    field: alt
    # Provide a pre-defined user prompt
    userPrompt: Summarize the provided image in maximum 10 words.
    # Prevent the user from editing the prompt
    editable: false
    # Use the file of the current Kirby file model as context
    files: auto
```

## Copilot for Blocks Fields

```yaml
sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      blocks:
        label: Blocks
        type: blocks

  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
```

## Copilot for Writer Fields

```yaml
sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      writer:
        label: Writer
        type: writer

  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: writer
```

## Copilot for Textarea Fields

```yaml
sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      textarea:
        label: Textarea
        type: textarea
        buttons: false

  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: textarea
    systemPrompt: Provide responses in plain text.
```

## Include Fields as Context

```yaml
sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      blocks:
        label: Blocks
        type: blocks

  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
    userPrompt: |
      What is the current date?
      (Hint, it is {date}!)
    files: false
```

## Predefined User Prompt

```yaml
sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      blocks:
        label: Blocks
        type: blocks

  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
    userPrompt: Write a short story about the future of the world.
```

## Immutable, Predefined User Prompt

```yaml
sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      blocks:
        label: Blocks
        type: blocks

  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
    userPrompt: Write a short story about the future of the world.
    editable: false
    files: false
```
