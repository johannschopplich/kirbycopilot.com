title: Files as Context
description: Use files as context for user prompts.

The Kirby Copilot plugin lets you select files to enrich the user prompt with additional information. For example, you can select product images and ask the AI to describe the product visually.

As of version 1.0.0, only **images** are supported. For the next minor version, we are planning to support **PDFs** as well. This feature is currently blocked by a [bug in Kirby](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6135), which will be resolved in the next minor version (4.1.0).

## Analyzing Images With GPT Vision

GPT-4 Turbo Vision is a powerful tool for processing images and text in the same prompt. To use the OpenAI GPT-4 Vision with Kirby Copilot, you need to have an OpenAI API key and access to the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model.

When images are added to the prompt, the GPT Vision model ([`model.vision` plugin option](/docs/configuration/global#model)) will generate content based on the prompt and the files, instead of the default model ([`model.default` plugin option](/docs/configuration/global#model)).

Unlike the user prompt, images are not written to local storage. Thus, a Panel refresh will remove all selected images.

Adding images to the user prompt will is only supported for usage with OpenAI. If you configure the Copilot plugin to use a different AI provider, the images will be ignored.

### Image Resizing

When the Panel user selects files, the plugin will automatically downscale all images to a maximum size of `2048px`. On the one hand, this ensures that the AI can process the images quickly, and on the other hand, it complies with the OpenAI image size limit of fitting into a 2048 pixel bounding box.

The resize browse happens directly in the browser.

## Extract Text From PDFs

Once the [bug in Kirby](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6135) is resolved, we will enable the extraction of text from PDFs. This will be done using a [custom build](https://github.com/johannschopplich/pdfjs-serverless) of [Mozilla's PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/).
