## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

:prose-video{src="/vid/kirby-tools-hub-license.mp4" poster="/vid/kirby-tools-hub-license-poster.jpg" width="908" height="540"}

#### Composer :u-badge{label="v1.5.1+" class="align-middle ml-2 !rounded-full" variant="subtle"}

The easiest and recommended way to install the plugin is via Composer. A private repository provided by us is required to install the plugin. Authentication is done via a license code that you receive from the Kirby Tools Hub after your purchase.

To get access to the private repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to [hub.kirby.tools](https://hub.kirby.tools). Log in with the email you used for the purchase and the order number.
2. After successful login, a license code will be displayed next to the Composer repository configuration.
3. Copy and paste the Composer configuration and paste it into your `composer.json` file.

Your `composer.json` file should look something like this:

```json [composer.json]
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "composer",
      "url": "https://repo.kirby.tools",
      "options": {
        "http": {
          "header": ["X-License: KT1-gd9Ymx30rM-ylZ3h6yF3l"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
The license code is unique to your purchase and should be kept private. Do not share it with anyone.
::

The Kirby Tools Composer repository is now set up. You can install the plugin by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require johannschopplich/kirby-copilot
```

For multiple plugins to be installed from the Kirby Tools Composer repository, include all license codes in the repository `header`. Separate each license code with a comma, e.g. `X-License: KT1-A, KT1-B`.

#### Download

After your purchase, you will receive a download link for the plugin. Download the ZIP file and extract it to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-copilot/
│  ├─ index.js
│  ├─ index.php
│  ├─ … other plugin files
```

### Step 2: AI Provider Configuration

Configure the AI provider by setting the **API key** and **AI model** in the global Kirby configuration. Each provider has its own configuration key. To get started with OpenAI, create a new [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and add it to the configuration along with the AI model such as GPT-4 Turbo:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'providers' => [
            'openai' => [
                'model' => 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',
                'apiKey' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

::callout{icon="i-ri-error-warning-line" color="amber"}
We recommend to create a unique API key for each project. This way, you can easily revoke access to the API key if needed.
::

### Step 3: Blueprint Setup

To display the Copilot section in the Kirby Panel, add a section of type `copilot` to your blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
```

The only required section property is `field`. This is the target field of the Kirby model that will be used to write the generated text to.

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
Supported field types are `blocks`, `writer`, `textarea` and `text`. Other field types will be added in the future if there is enough demand.
::

After adding the section, you can start using the plugin in the Kirby Panel. The accordion will be closed by default:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-closed.png"}
::

Click on the arrow to open the accordion and start entering your prompt:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-open.png"}
::
