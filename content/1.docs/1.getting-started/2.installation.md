## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

After your purchase, you will receive a download link for the plugin. Download the ZIP file and extract it to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
├─ kirby-copilot/
│  ├─ index.js
│  ├─ index.php
│  ├─ … other plugin files
```

Why not install the plugin using Composer? Honestly, because a private Composer repository is more expensive than what we charge for the plugin. If you have an idea how to set up a Composer package without breaking the bank, [feel free to reach out](/contact).

### Step 2: AI Provider Configuration

Configure the AI provider by setting the **API key** and **AI model** in the global Kirby configuration. Each provider has its own configuration key. To get started with OpenAI, create a new [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and add it to the configuration along with the AI model such as GPT-4 Turbo:

```php [config.php]
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'providers' => [
            'openai' => [
                'model' => 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',
                'apiKey' => 'YOUR_API_KEY'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

::callout{icon="i-ri-error-warning-line" color="amber"}
We recommend to create a unique API key for each project. This way, you can easily revoke access to the API key if needed.

### Step 3: Blueprint Setup

To display the Copilot section in the Kirby Panel, add a section of type `copilot` to your blueprint:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  copilot:
    type: copilot
    field: blocks
```

The only required section property is `field`. This is the target field of the Kirby model that will be used to write the generated text to.

::callout{icon="i-ri-information-line"}
Supported field types are `blocks`, `writer`, `textarea` and `text`. Other field types will be added in the future if there is enough demand.
::

After adding the section, you can start using the plugin in the Kirby Panel. The accordion will be closed by default:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-closed.png"}
::

Click on the arrow to open the accordion and start entering your prompt:

::preview{src="/img/copilot-section-open.png"}
::
