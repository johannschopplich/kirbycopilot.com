Released in May 2024, GPT-4o is the new flagship model from OpenAI. The model is now available in Kirby Copilot as the default OpenAI model. The `gpt-4o` model is a successor to the GPT-4 Turbo model and offers improved performance and capabilities.

To use the GPT-4o model in your Kirby Copilot configuration, update the `model` option to `gpt-4o`:

```diff
return [
    'johannschopplich.copilot' => [
        'providers' => [
            'openai' => [
-                'model' => 'gpt-4-turbo'
+                'model' => 'gpt-4o'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```
